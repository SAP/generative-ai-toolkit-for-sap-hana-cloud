# Generative AI Toolkit for SAP HANA Cloud

## About this project

Generative AI Client for SAP HANA Cloud is an extension of the existing HANA ML Python client library, mainly focusing on GenAI and related use cases. It includes many leading-edge GenAI related open source libraries and provides seamless integration with HANA ML, HANA vector engine, and other SAP GenAI Hub SDK, see our [Introduction](https://github.com/SAP/generative-ai-toolkit-for-sap-hana-cloud/blob/main/INTRODUCTION.md), [Notebook](https://github.com/SAP/generative-ai-toolkit-for-sap-hana-cloud/blob/main/nutest/testscripts/demo/e2e_scenarios/context_agent.ipynb) and [Documentation](https://sap.github.io/generative-ai-toolkit-for-sap-hana-cloud/).

## Requirements and Setup

The prerequisites for using the Generative AI Toolkit for SAP HANA Cloud are listed at [Prerequisites](https://sap.github.io/generative-ai-toolkit-for-sap-hana-cloud/hana_ai.html#prerequisites).

The Generative AI Toolkit for SAP HANA Cloud is available as a Python package. You can install it via `pip`:

```bash
pip install hana-ai
```

## ContextAgent

The toolkit includes a file-based ContextAgent for conversational forecasting and data-preparation workflows with Markdown-backed memory, tool calling, and runtime-selectable skills.

Core ContextAgent skills include:

- `data_ingestion_and_dataset_preparation` for CSV import and time-ordered train, test, and validation table creation
- `timeseries_data_profiling` for dataset reports and statistical checks before model selection
- `timeseries_forecasting` for single-series train, predict, score, and plot workflows
- `prediction_result_analysis` for predicted-versus-actual comparison and quality analysis
- `outlier_detection_and_repair_prep` for anomaly inspection before model training
- `massive_forecasting` for grouped forecasting across many related series
- `model_lifecycle_and_artifacts` for listing, deleting, and packaging saved models
- `hana_dataframe_fallback` for SQL transformations (Python fallback requires explicit trusted-host opt-in)

## Tools

The toolkit exposes HANAML-oriented tools for data preparation, profiling, forecasting, evaluation, artifact generation, and grouped forecasting workflows.

Core forecasting and analysis tools include:

- `import_csv_to_table`, `split_table_for_forecasting`, `fetch_data`
- `ts_dataset_report`, `ts_check`, `stationarity_test`, `trend_test`, `seasonality_test`, `white_noise_test`
- `automatic_timeseries_fit_and_save`, `automatic_timeseries_load_model_and_predict`, `automatic_timeseries_load_model_and_score`
- `additive_model_forecast_fit_and_save`, `additive_model_forecast_load_model_and_predict`, `intermittent_forecast`
- `ts_outlier_detection`, `ts_make_future_table`, `forecast_line_plot`, `accuracy_measure`
- `list_models`, `delete_models`, `cap_artifacts`, `hdi_artifacts`
- `SelectStatement_to_table`

Grouped and massive forecasting tools include:

- `massive_ts_check`, `massive_ts_outlier_detection`
- `massive_automatic_timeseries_fit_and_save`, `massive_automatic_timeseries_load_model_and_predict`, `massive_automatic_timeseries_load_model_and_score`
- `massive_additive_model_forecast_fit_and_save`, `massive_additive_model_forecast_load_model_and_predict`
- `ts_make_future_table_for_massive_forecast`

See the ContextAgent notebook for an end-to-end example at [nutest/testscripts/demo/e2e_scenarios/context_agent.ipynb](https://github.com/SAP/generative-ai-toolkit-for-sap-hana-cloud/blob/main/nutest/testscripts/demo/e2e_scenarios/context_agent.ipynb).

### Python execution trust boundary

`python_hanaml_exec` is **disabled by default** and is not included in the default
`HANAMLToolkit` tool list, including `used_tools='all'`, name-based selection, and
connection refreshes. Directly constructed instances also refuse to execute code
unless the host explicitly opts in. Tool-call arguments cannot enable execution.

This tool is **not a sandbox**. Code runs in the host process with its filesystem,
network, and HANA database permissions. The AST checks and reduced builtins are
best-effort guardrails only: full pandas/hana-ml objects support file I/O and raw
database access, and `sql()` does not enforce SQL authorization. There is no
execution timeout or resource isolation.

Applications that deliberately run **fully trusted code from trusted callers**
must construct `PythonHanaMLExecTool(connection_context=cc, allow_dangerous_code=True)`
from `hana_ai.tools.hana_ml_tools.python_exec_tools` and register that instance
using `toolkit.add_custom_tool(tool)`. Never expose an enabled instance to
untrusted agent or MCP callers. Untrusted-code execution requires a separately
designed OS-level isolation boundary, scoped credentials, and resource limits;
do not rely on this tool's syntax checks for containment.
