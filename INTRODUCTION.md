# Project description

## Introduction

Welcome to the __generative AI toolkit for SAP HANA Cloud (hana_ai)__

This project provides a toolkit of hana-ml-oriented tools and a file-based ContextAgent for conversational SAP HANA Cloud forecasting and machine learning workflows. It focuses on reusable HANAMLToolkit integrations, workflow skills for data preparation and forecasting tasks, and tool-driven execution against SAP HANA Cloud machine learning functions.

## Overview
The generative AI toolkit for SAP HANA Cloud provides the following key capabilities:
* a file-based ContextAgent with Markdown memory, runtime skill routing, and command-style memory/skill controls for iterative forecasting workflows
* a library of prepared tools to streamline use of SAP HANA machine learning functions and aid in e.g. forecast algorithm selection with the given data
* tools for leveraging the SAP HANA Cloud vectorstore and embedding services

# Capabilities introduction

## ContextAgent with Markdown memory and skills
The file-based ContextAgent (agents.context_agent.ContextAgent class) is designed for tool-enabled, multi-turn workflows without requiring HANA-backed memory services. It persists conversation state to Markdown files, retrieves compact notes into context, and activates focused workflow skills depending on the request.

```python
from hana_ai.tools.toolkit import HANAMLToolkit
from hana_ai.agents.context_agent import ContextAgent

tools = HANAMLToolkit(cc, used_tools='all').get_tools()
agent = ContextAgent(llm=llm, tools=tools, storage_dir=".context_agent")

response = agent.chat("Import this csv, split it into train, test, and validation tables, then recommend a forecasting model.")
```

The ContextAgent currently supports the following workflow skills:

| Skill Name | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| data_ingestion_and_dataset_preparation | Import CSV data into HANA and create time-ordered train, test, and validation tables. |
| timeseries_data_profiling | Inspect a time series dataset with reports and statistical checks before modeling. |
| timeseries_forecasting | Train, predict, score, and summarize a single-series forecasting workflow. |
| prediction_result_analysis | Compare predicted results with actuals and summarize forecast quality. |
| outlier_detection_and_repair_prep | Detect anomalous points or groups before modeling. |
| massive_forecasting | Run grouped forecasting across many related series with group_key-aware tools. |
| model_lifecycle_and_artifacts | List, delete, and package saved models as CAP or HDI artifacts. |
| hana_dataframe_fallback | Materialize SQL fallback logic when dedicated tools are insufficient; Python requires explicit trusted-host opt-in. |

The ContextAgent also exposes command-style controls during `chat()`:

- Memory commands: `!clear_notes`, `!clear_session`, `!reset_memory`, `!clear_notes_file`, `!clear_todo`, `!clear_decisions`, `!clear_context`, `!clear_chat`, `!clear_summary`
- Skill commands: `!list_skills`, `!active_skills`, `!skills_on`, `!skills_off`, `!enable_skill <skill_name>`, `!disable_skill <skill_name>`

## Library of tools for HANA-ML
