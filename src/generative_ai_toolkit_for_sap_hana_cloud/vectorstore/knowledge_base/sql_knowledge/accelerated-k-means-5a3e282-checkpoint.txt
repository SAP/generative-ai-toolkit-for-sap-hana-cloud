Accelerated k-means is a variant of the k-means algorithm that uses technology to speed up the calculation process. It has two steps in each iteration: assigning each point to a cluster with the closest distance to its center, and calculating the new center of each cluster. The center set and cluster partition set are the same as the ordinary k-means after each iteration. 

To accelerate iterations, accelerated k-means uses caches to store information between iterations, which requires more memory than the ordinary k-means. It also differs from ordinary k-means in that it keeps iterating until all clusters stop changing, instead of using an EXIT_THRESHOLD parameter to stop earlier.

Accelerated k-means also supports categorical attributes. If an attribute is of category type, it is converted into a binary vector and used as a numerical attribute. For example, if "Gender" is a categorical attribute with two distinct values (Female and Male), it will be converted into a binary vector with two dimensions (Gender_1 and Gender_2). The Euclidean distance between points is then calculated using a formula that takes into account the weight given to the categorical attributes.

The means of categorical attributes are not outputted in accelerated k-means. Instead, they are replaced by the modes, similar to the k-modes algorithm. The mode is determined by selecting the maximum value for each categorical attribute.
